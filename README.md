Beginner level data scraping, data cleansing, and machine learning on cricket stats from the Mason Cricket League.

My project is for the most part finished. Overall, I am content with how it turned out.
The next steps for this project would be to put it on the cloud and to add more machine learning to the projections.
My only regrets with this project were my documentation and my naming conventions. Both of these were not consistent, and my documentation is very bare. For my future projects I want to make sure that those and my overall project structure are more organized.
